# Stress_Level_Prediction

# Stress Level Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts stress levels based on a dataset containing 13 features and 374 data points. It applies multiple regression algorithms to find the best model for accurate stress prediction.

## Dataset
- 13 columns (features)
- 374 rows (samples)

## Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression (best performing)
- Support Vector Regression

## User Interface
The UI is built with Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Run the following command in the terminal: streamlit run stress_prediction.py
4. This will launch the Streamlit app where you can input data and get stress level predictions.
